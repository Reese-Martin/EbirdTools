# EbirdTools
a collection of tools for analyzing data from eBird data. I am a bird nerd who wanted better ways to see my bird numbers so I figured I should be the change I wanted to see in the world.

## Visualize_Data.py
provides some nicer visualizations for eBird data especially the accumulation of lifers over time and polar plots that let you compare how your current year is doing compared to previous ones. This project is nowhere near done and I expect to add more functionality over the coming weeks as I refine the visualizations I like and make the dashboard cleaner/more interactive.
